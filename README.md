# CubeClash

CubeClash is an online platform designed to facilitate competitive head-to-head speedcubing.
The app adopts an ELO-based matchmaking system similar to that used for other one-on-one online 
competitions such as chess and various eSports.

## How to CubeClash
### Signing up
When you sign up for CubeClash for the first time, you'll be prompted to sign in
with your WCA account. Keep in mind, you don't need a WCA ID to use CubeClash – even if
you haven't competed officially, you can still create a WCA account and use that to sign in to
CubeClash.

Your username is used to identify you across the site. Usernames can be changed at any time, but
they are automatically assigned when you sign up. Your default username will be either your WCA ID (recommended) or
randomly-generated.

### Your ELO
Your ELO is a number rating that reflects your ability.

If you have a history of official WCA results, your personal records will be used to estimate your initial ELO.

If you have not competed (or have not completed an official 3x3 average of five), you will be prompted to self-select your
global average. This will be used to estimate your initial ELO.

Your ELO will change depending on the actual outcomes of your battles and what the predicted outcomes were. You can learn more about
this rating system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

CubeClash's random matchmaking algorithm attempts to create battles between queued users with the closest ELOs to help ensure fair matches.
